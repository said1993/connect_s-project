connect_s is microservices application is designed to handle meetup and event management. The application is divided into several small, independently deployable services, each with a specific responsibility.

## Services

- A user service that handles user registration, authentication, and authorization (In progress, I will add it later).
- An event service that manages the creation, update, and retrieval of events: [events service](https://github.com/said1993/connect_s-events) .
- And other services in progress.

# Open Source and Hosted on GitHub

Our application is open source and hosted on GitHub, where you can find the code and documentation for each service, as well as instructions for running and deploying the application.
